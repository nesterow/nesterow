Currently I am not very active on the social networks. 
I'll create a feed for updates without slop. 
In the mean time you can shoot questions in direct:

**A word on VSKI**

> [VSKI](https://github.com/vski-ai/sdk/) is my passion project.
> It's a swiss-knife platform that allows to create *almost anything* employing "Code As Infra" approach.
> The server is a small binary file (~8mb) that can be deployed standalone and work in federation with other servers if allowed.
