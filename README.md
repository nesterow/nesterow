**Contacts**

Currently I am not very active on the social networks. 
I'll create a feed for updates without slop. 
In the mean time you can shoot questions in direct:

**A word on VSKI**

> [VSKI](https://github.com/vski-ai/sdk/) is my passion project.
> It's a swiss-knife platform that allows to create *almost anything* employing "Code As Infra" approach.
> The server is a small binary file that can be deployed standalone and work in federation with other servers if allowed. 
> There are several major milestones left before the project is available for download.  
> Current versions are pre-release reference implementations that require db and redis to function. 
> Howerver, The goal is to create a small standalone executable less than 1mb in size.
